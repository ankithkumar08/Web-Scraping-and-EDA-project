## 📁 Dataset Information

- **Source:** [Kaggle - Hotel Booking Demand](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand)
- **Filename:** `hotel_bookings.csv`

The dataset contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel. It includes details such as booking dates, length of stay, number of guests, customer type, and whether the booking was canceled.

---

## 🔍 Objective

To analyze and visualize hotel booking data to identify:
- Trends in booking and cancellations
- Factors influencing cancellations
- Guest preferences and patterns
- Revenue-related insights

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Language:** Python  
- **IDE:** Jupyter Notebook  
- **Libraries:**  
  - `pandas`  
  - `matplotlib`  
  - `seaborn`

## 🧪 Key Questions Explored

- What percentage of bookings were canceled?
- Which hotel type receives more bookings?
- What is the average lead time for bookings?
- What months are the busiest?
- Which countries book the most?
- What types of customers tend to cancel?
- How does ADR (Average Daily Rate) change over time?

---

## 📊 Visualizations

The analysis includes various plots:
- Booking Cancellation Rate by Hotel
- Monthly Booking Trends
- Lead Time Distribution
- Country-wise Booking Frequency
- Customer Type and Cancellation Rate
- Special Requests and Cancellations
- ADR Trends by Month and Hotel

---

## 📈 Insights

- City hotels have higher cancellation rates than resort hotels.
- Most bookings are made in the summer months.
- Guests with higher lead time are more likely to cancel.
- Repeated guests are less likely to cancel.
- Bookings from Portugal dominate the dataset.

---

## 🔮 Future Work

- Build machine learning models to predict booking cancellations.
- Use Power BI or Tableau for interactive dashboards.
- Perform customer segmentation using clustering algorithms.
